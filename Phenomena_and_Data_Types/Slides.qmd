What is Data?
=============
::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}

Data is information describing some phenomenon.
:::

What is a Phenomenon?
---------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


A factor situation that is observed to exist or happen, especially one whose cause or explanation is in question.


* A lightning strike

Types of Phenomena
------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


**Discrete Objects**


* Distinct boundaries
+ Chat can be exactly measured

* Finite
+ They are countable and cannot be infinitely subdivided
:::
:::{.column width="50%"}


**Continuous Fields**


- No distinct boundaries

* Everywhere has a value


- Infinitely divisible

* They are not countable and can be infinitely subdivided

:::
::::

Types of Phenomena
------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


When is a phenomenon **discrete** or **continuous**?


* To an extent, it depends on our *perspective* and the *scale* of our analysis.
* Many phenomenon are a bit of both.

:::
::::

Lightning
---------


A **strike** is a discrete object, what about a lighting bolt?

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

* Sort of continuous?

:::
:::{.column width="50%"}


![](images/lightning.jpg){width="60%"}


:::
::::


Lightning
---------


A **strike** is a discrete object, what about a lighting bolt?

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

* Strike **frequency** is a continuous field
  + Everywhere has a value
  + Even the absence of strikes, is a frequency of strikes

:::
:::{.column width="50%"}

![](images/03-lightning-density.gif){}

:::
::::


A Coastline
-----------

Continuous field at **large scale**

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

+ Tides & waves
+ Where is the exact boundary?

:::
:::{.column width="50%"}

![](images/beach.jpg)

:::
::::


A Coastline
-----------

Discrete object at **small scale**

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


* Zoom out and the tides/waves don't really matter
+ Its easy to draw a static boundary

:::
:::{.column width="50%"}


![](images/beach_small_scale.png)

:::

A Coastline
-----------

Unless you change the [*time scale*](https://coastal.climatecentral.org/)


![](images/sea_level_rise.png)

Types of Phenomena
------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Most things don't fall perfectly into one category or the other.


* That said, it is a helpful framework as long as we recognize the discrete vs. continuous dichotomy is not a perfect classification

:::
::::

TopHat Question 1
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Discrete objects: (select all that apply)


* Are countable
* Do not have distinct boundaries
* Are infinitely divisible
* Have well defined boundaries

:::
::::

Discrete Objects
----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


**Buildings** are a great example.


* Concrete boundaries
* Countable
* Real physical object
:::
:::{.column width="50%"}
![](images/building.png)

:::
::::

Discrete Objects
----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


**Political Boundaries** are also a great example.


* Distinct boundaries
* Countable
* Not a physical object
:::
:::{.column width="50%"}
![](images/03-vector.png)

:::
::::

Continuous Fields
-----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


**Elevation** is a great example.


* Everywhere on Earth
* No "number of elevations"
* A physical property
:::
:::{.column width="50%"}
![](images/elevation.png)

:::
::::

Continuous Fields
-----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


**Density of tweets** is also a great example.


* Everywhere has this too
* Derived from something countable
+ But not countable itself

* Not a physical property
:::
:::{.column width="50%"}
![](images/tweet_density.jpg)

:::
::::

Working Together
----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}


Frequently we'll end up working with both discrete objects and continuous fields.


* In Module 1, you worked with:
  + Cholera deaths
    - **Discrete objects**
  + Kernel density
    - **Continuous field**

Digital information
-------------------

We'll talk more about spatial data models later. For now, lets think about data more broadly. 

* How do we represent data in a computer?

Digital information
-------------------

Digital information is represented as bits (0's and 1's)

* We typically quantify data as bytes (8 bits):

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}

+ Kilobyte (kB) = 1,000 bytes
+ Megabyte (MB) = 1,000,000 bytes
+ Gigabyte (GB) = 1,000,000,000 bytes

:::
:::{.column width="40%"}
![](images/bit-vs-byte-illustration.jpg)

:::
::::


Digital information
-------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


There are numerous ways to translate human readable data to binary, such as ASCII.


* Each character is represented as one byte
* 2<sup>8</sup> = 256 unique combinations of 0's and 1's in a byte
* Some examples:
  + "A" : 01000001
  + "CAT": 01000011 01000001 01010100
  + "31": 00110011 00110001

:::
::::

Digital Information
-------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Modern computers use 64-bit "architecture". The central processing unit (CPU) can handle 64 bits (8 bytes) of information at a time.


* **"Word"** length is 64 bits, a word is a unit of data
  + i.e., an individual piece of information

  + 18 quintillion unique combinations of 1's and 0's

* CPUs can be stacked in parallel to handle more information at one time

:::
::::

Representing Phenomena in GIS
-----------------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Within the context of a GIS, every piece of information describing a phenomenon is referred to as an **Attribute**.


* Broadly speaking each attribute can address one of three questions:
  + **Where?**
  + **What?**
  + **When?**

:::
::::

Types of Attributes
-------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


There are multiple ways to classify/think about attributes. One important distinction we must make


* **Non-Spatial Attributes**: describe what or when
* **Spatial Attributes**: describe where
  + Puts the **G**eographic in **G**IS
  + Requires some special considerations
  - We have already talked a bit about map projections
  - We'll discuss more considerations in the next module

:::
::::

Types of Attributes
-------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


All data (attributes), spatial and non-spatial, can be either **qualitative** or **quantitative**.


* The types of analysis we can do with qualitative data are more limited
* That does not make quantitative data “better”
* **Measurement scales**: both qualitative and quantitative can be measured on different scales
  + Qualitative: Nominal or Ordinal Sales
  + Quantitative: Interval or Ratio Sales

:::
::::

Qualitative Data
----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Qualitative data is **Categorical**. It is strictly descriptive and lacks any meaningful numeric value.


* Textual, coded numerals, pictures, sounds, etc
  + Typically working with textual & coded numerals most frequently in GIS

* Limited number of computational options, often requires careful consideration when analyzing
* Measured on either a **Nominal** or **Ordinal** scale.

:::
::::

Nominal Scale
-------------

Names or categories **with no** ranking or direction. Categories are not more/less, better/worse, they just different. Some examples include:

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

* Flower Species

:::
:::{.column width="50%"}

![](images/03-flowers-nominal.png)

![](images/03-lc-class.png)


:::

Nominal Operations
------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


With nominal data we can:


* Check equivalency
* Count frequencies
* **Nothing else**
:::
:::{.column width="50%"}


![](images/03-nominal-opperations.png)

:::
::::

Ordinal Scale
-------------

Names or categories **with a** ranking. The differences are relative. Categories **are** more/less, better/worse, etc. 

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


* Spice levels

:::
:::{.column width="50%"}

![](images/03-spicy.jpg)

:::
::::

Ordinal Scale
-------------

Names or categories **with a** ranking. The differences are relative. Categories **are** more/less, better/worse, etc. 

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


* Spice levels
* Relative heights

:::
:::{.column width="50%"}

![](images/03-dogs-ordinal.png){width="55%"}

:::
::::

Ordinal Scale
-------------

Names or categories **with a** ranking. The differences are relative. Categories **are** more/less, better/worse, etc. 

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


* Spice levels
* Relative heights
* Compass Direction

:::
:::{.column width="50%"}

![](images/03-compas.png){width="70%"}


:::
::::

Ordinal Operations
------------------

All the same operations as nominal data **+ more**.  With ordinal data we can:

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

* Check equivalency
* Count frequencies
* **Check order/rank**

:::
:::{.column width="50%"}

![](images/03-spicy.jpg)

:::
::::

Ordinal Operations
------------------


*Sometimes* we can calculate the median.

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="40%"}


* Odd sets the median is the middle.
* Even sets, average of the middle two.
* One solution, *arbitrarily* assign a numeric score.

:::
:::{.column width="60%"}

![](images/03-ordinal-operatons.png){width="110%"}

:::
::::

Graded Membership
-----------------

**Exceptions** that blur the lines.  Where to draw the line between forest/alpine?

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

* Grade membership to assign categories
* **Winner take all**: alpine meadow
  + 45% alpine meadow
  + 40% forest
  + 5% bare rock

:::
:::{.column width="50%"}
![](images/03-fuzzy.jpg)

:::
::::

Graded Membership
-----------------

In practice, lots of qualitative data we work with, especially for *natural phenomena*, are actually graded membership.

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


* **The downside**: variability within the area is lost.
:::
:::{.column width="50%"}

TopHat Question 2
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Which of the following would be examples of Nominal Data? (select all that apply)


* Air temperature
* Ice cream flavors
* Tree height
* Colors
* Drink sizes

:::
::::

Quantitative Data
-----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Quantitative data is **Numeric**. It describe the quantities associated with a phenomenon. Key properties include:


* Values separated by a meaningful unit.
* More arithmetic operations possible.
* Can be **Discrete** or **Continuous** numbers.
* Measured on either a **Ratio** or **Interval** scale.

:::
::::

Kinds of Numbers
----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


**Discrete**


* Whole numbers
* Counts
* Not infinitely divisible
* Names in ArcGIS Pro:
+ Integer, Long, etc.
:::
:::{.column width="50%"}


**Continuous**


* Decimals
* Measurements
* Infinitely divisible
* Names in ArcGIS Pro:
+ Float, Double, etc.

:::
::::

Kinds of Numbers
----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

+ Speed

:::
::::

Quantitative Data
-----------------

Both **Interval** and **Ratio** data can consist of discrete *or* continuous numbers. These types of quantitative data are closely related, but have one important distinction.


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}



* Interval scales have an arbitrary zero point
  + **Can** be negative
  + **Cannot** multiply/divide
    - To compare magnitudes

:::
:::{.column width="50%"}

* Ratio scales have a fixed, absolute zero point
  + **Can** multiply/divide
  + **Cannot** be negative
    - Can increase infinitely from zero


:::
::::

Celsius (interval) vs. Kelvin (ratio)
--------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

°C = K-273.15.

* 0 °C: Freezing point of water
  + Drops below 0 °C all the time

* 0 K: "Absolute Zero"
  + Physically cannot get any colder

:::
:::{.column width="50%"}

![](images/03-interval-ratio-temperature.png)

:::
::::

Celsius (interval) vs. Kelvin (ratio)
--------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

°C = K-273.15.

* 100 °C **is not** ∞% warmer than as 0 °C
  + It's actually ~ 36% warmer
  + (373.15 K - 273.15 K) ⁄ 273.15 K ~ 0.36

:::

Interval Scale
--------------

Interval data has an arbitrary zero point.

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

* Calendar years
  + *Discrete* interval data

* Temperature (in celsius)
  + *Continuous* interval data

* Other examples:
  + ph scale (continuous)
  + Times (discrete-ish)

TopHat Question 3
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Match the value to the type measurement scale and type of number:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Length a hiking trail | Interval (Discrete) |
| Temperature in Fahrenheit  | Ratio (Discrete) |
| Global Orca Population | Ratio (Continuous) |
| Change in Global Orca Population from 2000 to 2022 | Interval (Continuous) |

:::
::::

Derived Ratio
-------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Sometimes called normalizing or standardizing, we calculate derived ratios to account for the influence of a confounding variable over a variable of interest. e.x. Housing affordability (*Ha*):


* You need to account for income (*I*) to figure out how affordable rent (*R*) is: 
$H\_a = \frac{R}{I}$
  + ***Ha***: 31.5% of my income goes to rent
  + Income and rent ($) are both discrete, housing affordability (%) is continuous.

:::
::::

Derived Ratio
-------------


In Lab, you are going to work with two derived ratios:

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

* Income and Food expenditures are correlated
  + Need to account for income if you analyze other factors

:::
:::{.column width="50%"}

Derived Ratio
-------------


In Lab, you are going to work with two derived ratios:

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

* Population and Area are not highly correlated
  + But area definitely influences population
  + Need to account for area to analyze other factors
  
:::

TopHat Question 4
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Speed is another example of a derived ratio. If a line of thunderstorm takes 5 hours to travel from Brandon, MB to Winnipeg, MB (200 km), what is the storm's speed in km/hr?
