What is Data?
=============



::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}

Data is information describing some phenomenon.

What is a Phenomenon?
---------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Phenomenon: a fact or situation that is observed to exist or happen, especially one whose cause or explanation is in question.


* A lightning strike
* A coastline
* A country
* A dog on a kayak!
* Anything and everything are phenomena!

Types of Phenomena
------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


**Discrete Objects**


* Distinct boundaries
+ Chat can be exactly measured

* Finite
+ They are countable and cannot be infinitely subdivided



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}


**Continuous Fields**


- No distinct boundaries

* Everywhere has a value


- Infinitely divisible

* They are not countable and can be infinitely subdivided




:::
::::




Types of Phenomena
------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


When is a phenomenon **discrete** or **continuous**?


* To an extent, it depends on our *perspective* and the *scale* of our analysis.
* Many phenomenon are a bit of both.




:::
::::




Lightning
---------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


* A **strike** is a discrete object
* What about a lighting bolt ...?
+ Doesn't really have clearly defined boundaries?
+ Sort of continuous

* Strike **frequency** is a continuous field
+ Everywhere has a frequency of lighting strikes
+ Even the absence of lighting strikes, is still a frequency of strikes



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}

A Coastline
-----------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


* Continuous field at **large scale**
+ Tides & waves
+ Where is the exact boundary?

* Discrete object at **small scale**
+ Zoom out and the tides/waves don't really matter
+ Its easy to draw a static boundary

* Unless you change the [*time scale*](https://coastal.climatecentral.org/)
+ Until you start thinking about the long term :(

Types of Phenomena
------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Most things don't fall perfectly into one category or the other.


* That said, it is a helpful framework as long as we recognize the discrete vs. continuous dichotomy is not a perfect classification




:::

TopHat Question 1
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Discrete objects: (select all that apply)


* Are countable
* Do not have distinct boundaries
* Are infinitely divisible
* Have well defined boundaries




:::
::::




Discrete Objects
----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


**Buildings** are a great example.


* Concrete boundaries
* Countable
* Real physical object



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}



![](images/building.png)




:::
::::




Discrete Objects
----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


**Political Boundaries** are also a great example.


* Distinct boundaries
* Countable
* Not a physical object



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}



![](images/03-vector.png)




:::
::::




Continuous Fields
-----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


**Elevation** is a great example.


* Everywhere on Earth
* No "number of elevations"
* A physical property



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}



![](images/elevation.png)




:::
::::




Continuous Fields
-----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


**Density of tweets** is also a great example.


* Everywhere has this too
* Derived from something countable
+ But not countable itself

* Not a physical property



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}



![](images/tweet_density.jpg)




:::
::::




Working Together
----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Frequently we'll end up working with both discrete objects and continuous fields.


* In Module 1, you worked with:
+ Cholera deaths (Discrete objects)
+ Kernel density (continuous field)

* We use **spatial data models** to represent information in a GIS
+ **Vector Data Model** = discrete objects
+ **Raster Data Model** = continuous fields



:::

Digital information
-------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


We'll talk more about spatial data models later. For now, lets think about data more broadly. How do we represent data in a computer?


* Digital information is represented as bits (0's and 1's)
* We typically quantify data as bytes (8 bits):
+ Kilobyte (kB) = 1,000 bytes
+ Megabyte (MB) = 1,000,000 bytes
+ Gigabyte (GB) = 1,000,000,000 bytes



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}



![](images/bit-vs-byte-illustration.jpg)




:::
::::




Digital information
-------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


There are numerous ways to translate human readable data to binary, such as ASCII.


* Each character is represented as one byte
* There are 28 = 256 unique combinations of 0's and 1's in a byte
* Some examples:
+ "A" : 01000001
+ "CAT": 01000011 01000001 01010100
+ "31": 00110011 00110001




:::
::::




Digital Information
-------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Modern computers use 64-bit "architecture". That is, the central processing unit (CPU) can handle 64 bits (8 bytes) of information at a time.


* **"Word"** length is 64 bits
+ A "Word" is a unit of data
- i.e., an individual piece of information

+ 264 possible unique values
- >18 quintillion possible unique combinations of 1's and 0's to describe something

* CPUs can be stacked in parallel to handle more information at one time




:::
::::




Representing Phenomena in GIS
-----------------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Within the context of a GIS, every piece of information describing a phenomenon is referred to as an **Attribute**.


* Broadly speaking each attribute can address one of three questions:
+ **Where?**
+ **What?**
+ **When?**




:::
::::




Types of Attributes
-------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


There are multiple ways to classify/think about attributes. One important distinction we must make


* **Non-Spatial Attributes**: describe what or when
* **Spatial Attributes**: describe where
+ Puts the **G**eographic in **G**IS
+ Requires some special considerations
- We have already talked a bit about these consideration (map projections)
- We'll discuss more considerations in the next module




:::
::::




Types of Attributes
-------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


All data (attributes), spatial and non-spatial, can be either **qualitative** or **quantitative**.


* The types of analysis we can do with qualitative data are more limited
* That does not make quantitative data “better”
* **Measurement scales**: both qualitative and quantitative can be measured on different scales
+ Qualitative: Nominal or Ordinal Sales
+ Quantitative: Interval or Ratio Sales




:::
::::




Qualitative Data
----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Qualitative data is **Categorical**. It is strictly descriptive and lacks any meaningful numeric value.


* Textual, coded numerals, pictures, sounds, etc
+ Typically working with textual & coded numerals most frequently in GIS

* Limited number of computational options, often requires careful consideration when analyzing
* Measured on either a **Nominal** or **Ordinal** scale.




:::
::::




Nominal Scale
-------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Names or categories **with no** ranking or direction. Categories are not more/less, better/worse, they just different. Some examples include:


* Flower Species
* Zoning Categories
* Land cover Classification



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}




![](images/03-flowers-nominal.png)





![](images/03-zoning.png)





![](images/03-lc-class.png)





:::
::::




Nominal Operations
------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


With nominal data we can:


* Check equivalency
* Count frequencies
* **Nothing else**



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}


![](images/03-nominal-opperations.png)




:::
::::




Ordinal Scale
-------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Names or categories **with a** ranking or direction. Categories **are** more/less, better/worse, etc. But the differences are relative, there is no way to say by "how much". Some examples include:


* Spice levels
* Relative heights
* Compass Direction



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}




![](images/03-spicy.jpg)





![](images/03-dogs-ordinal.png)





![](images/03-compas.png)





:::
::::




Ordinal Operations
------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


With ordinal data we can:


* Check equivalency
* Count frequencies
* **Check order/rank**


All the same operations as nominal data **+ more**.



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}



![](images/03-spicy.jpg)




:::
::::




Ordinal Operations
------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


*Sometimes* we can calculate the median.


* Odd sets the median is the middle.
* Even sets, average of the middle two.
* One solution, *arbitrarily* assign a numeric score.


All the same operations as nominal data **+ more**.



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}



![](images/03-ordinal-operatons.png)




:::
::::




Graded Membership
-----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


**Exceptions** that blur the lines.


* Grade membership to assign categories
* Where to draw the line between forest/alpine?
* **Winner take all**: alpine meadow
+ 45% alpine meadow
+ 40% forest
+ 5% bare rock



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}



![](images/03-fuzzy.jpg)




:::
::::




Graded Membership
-----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


In practice, lots of qualitative data we work with, especially for *natural phenomena*, are actually graded membership.


* **The downside**: variability within the area is lost.



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}



![](images/03-fuzzy.jpg)




:::
::::




TopHat Question 2
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Which of the following would be examples of Nominal Data? (select all that apply)


* Air temperature
* Ice cream flavors
* Tree height
* Colors
* Drink sizes




:::
::::




Quantitative Data
-----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Quantitative data is **Numeric**. It describe the quantities associated with a phenomenon. Key properties include:


* Values separated by a meaningful unit.
* More arithmetic operations possible.
* Can be **Discrete** or **Continuous** numbers.
* Measured on either a **Ratio** or **Interval** scale.




:::
::::




Kinds of Numbers
----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


**Discrete**


* Whole numbers
* Counts
* Not infinitely divisible
* Names in ArcGIS Pro:
+ Integer, Long, etc.



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}


**Continuous**


* Decimals
* Measurements
* Infinitely divisible
* Names in ArcGIS Pro:
+ Float, Double, etc.




:::
::::




Kinds of Numbers
----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


**Discrete**


* Countable
* Examples:
+ Population
+ Year
+ "Age"



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}


**Continuous**


* Non-countable
* Examples:
+ Temperature
+ Height
+ Speed




:::
::::




Quantitative Data
-----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Both **Interval** and **Ratio** data can consist of discrete *or* continuous numbers. These types of quantitative data are closely related, but have one important distinction.


* Interval scales have an arbitrarily zero point, which means:
+ **Can** have negative values
+ **Cannot** multiply/divide ...
- To compare the magnitude of one value to another
- Can still multiply/divide for other calculations, i.e. calculating an average

* Ratio scales have a fixed, absolute zero point, which means:
+ **Cannot** have negative values
- Absolute zero point does not imply an end point, can still have infinitely many values

+ **Can** multiply/divide




:::
::::




The Difference
--------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


**Celsius** (interval) vs. **Kelvin** (ratio).


* °C = K-273.15.
* 0 °C: Freezing point of water
+ Drops below 0 °C all the time

* 0 K: "Absolute Zero"
+ Physically cannot get any colder

* 100 °C **is not** ∞% warmer than as 0 °C
+ It's actually ~ 36% warmer
+ (373.15 K - 273.15 K) ⁄ 273.15 K ~ 0.36



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}



![](images/03-interval-ratio-temperature.png)




:::
::::




Interval Scale
--------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Interval data has an arbitrarily zero point. Examples include:


* Calendar years
+ *Discrete* interval data

* Temperature (in celsius)
+ *Continuous* interval data

* Other examples:
+ ph scale (continuous)
+ IQ scores (continuous)
+ Times (discrete-ish)



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}




![](images/CalendarYears.png)





![](images/CA_Temp.gif)





:::
::::




Ratio Scale
-----------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Ratio data has a fixed, absolute zero point. Examples include:


* Population
+ *Discrete* ratio data

* Tree height
+ *Continuous* ratio data

* Other examples:
+ Precipitation (Continuous)
+ Area (Continuous)
+ Units of time (Continuous)
+ Popular Vote Totals (Discrete)

TopHat Question 3
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Match the value to the type measurement scale and type of number:




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Length a hiking trail | Interval (Discrete) |
| Temperature in Fahrenheit  | Ratio (Discrete) |
| Global Orca Population | Ratio (Continuous) |
| Change in Global Orca Population from 2000 to 2022 | Interval (Continuous) |




:::
::::




Derived Ratio
-------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Sometimes called normalizing or standardizing, we calculate derived ratios to account for the influence of a confounding variable over a variable of interest. e.x. Housing affordability (*Ha*):


* You need to account for income (*I*) to figure out how affordable rent (*R*) is:
 
 $$ H\_a = \frac{R}{I} $$
 + **R**: My rent $1,450/mo
+ **I**: I make ~$4600/mo
+ ***Ha***: 31.5% of my income goes to rent
+ Income and rent ($) are both discrete, housing affordability (%) is continuous.




:::
::::




Derived Ratio
-------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


In [Lab](https://geos270.github.io/Module3/docs/Application.html), you are going to work with two derived ratios:


* Income and Food expenditures are correlated
+ Need to account for income if you analyze other factors

* Population and Area are not highly correlated
+ But area definitely influences population
+ Need to account for area to analyze other factors



:::

TopHat Question 4
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Speed is another example of a derived ratio. If a line of thunderstorm takes 5 hours to travel from Brandon, MB to Winnipeg, MB (200 km), what is the storm's speed in km/hr?
