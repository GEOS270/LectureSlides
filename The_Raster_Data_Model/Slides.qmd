Raster Data Model
=================



::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


 A simple, storage intensive format best suited for **continuous fields**.
 
:::
::::




Raster Data Model
-----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Represents space **continuously**:


* Rectangular grid of equally sized cells
* Each cell only has **one value**



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}

Raster Data Model
-----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Multiple attributes, require multiple **bands**
* Standard color photos have three bands:
	+ Red, green, & blue
* LANDSAT8 has 11 bands:
	+ "False Color Images"
	+ Spectral Indices (NDVI)

Resolution vs. Extent
---------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


**Resolution**: (aka cell size) is the smallest resolvable feature.


* 1 m x 1 m = 1 m2


**Extent**: (aka domain) depends on number of rows and columns along with the cell size.


* 5 rows x 5 columns = 25 cells
* 1 m cell size
* Covers 5 m x 5 m = 25 m2

:::{.column width="50%"}

Resolution vs. Extent
---------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


**Resolution**: 10 m cell size = 100 m2 area per cell.  

**Extent**: varies with number of cells and cell size.




| Rows | Columns | Extent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 | 5 | 50 m x 50 m = 2,500 m2 |
| 5 | 10 | 50 m x 100 m = 5,000 m2 |
| 100 | 100 | 1,000 m x 1,000 m = 1,000,000 m2 |

TopHat Question 1
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Raster resolution is dictated by the number of rows and columns, raster extent is dictated by the cell size.


* True
* False
* Sometimes True, Sometimes False




:::

Mixed Pixel Problem
-------------------



One cell: one value


* What if it covers multiple values?
+ A: Winner take all
+ B: Cell center

* Other options?
+ Containment - if a value of interest is anywhere within a cell
- e.g. invasive species presence

Implications
------------



Loss of information during rasterization.


* A "bigger" issue for larger cells.
* At a certain point features become unrecognizable.
* Higher resolution = larger file for equivalent areas.

TopHat Question 2
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


This term describes how information is lost when creating a raster image.


* Resolution
* Domain
* Mixed pixel problem
* Rasterization




:::
::::




File Size
---------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


The number of cells per image dictates file size.


* Cells = rows x columns x bands
* Increases **exponentially** with resolution
+ For a given extent

* Increases **linearly** with number of bands



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}




| Extent | Bands | Cell Size | Number of Cells |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1x1km | 1 | 100m | 100 |
| 1x1km | 1 | 1m | 1,000,000 |
 1x1km | 3 | 100m | 300 |
| 1x1km | 3 | 1m | 3,000,000 |

Why does this matter?
---------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Downloading, uploading, and processing times will all increase as the file size increases.


* Large raster datasets are computationally "expensive"
+ More cells = more "overhead"

* Practically speaking, how will this impact you?

TopHat Question 3
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


You downloaded a 3 band LANDSAT8 image covering the UBC campus. The image's dimensions are 6000m (rows) by 4500m (columns) and the resolution (cell size) is 30m. How many cells does the image contain?


* 30,000
* 90,000
* 900,000
* 2,700,000
* 27,000,000
* 81,000,000

Raster Overlay
--------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Raster data can be used to evaluate algebraic expressions easily and efficiently.


* A: Winter Temperature
* B: Summer Temperature
* Range: B-A
* Average: (A+B)/2

Raster Calculator
-----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


The tool for this in Arc is called the "Raster Calculator"


* Raster layers can be "variables" in linear equations
* Perform simple calculations incorporating one or multiple layers
* Ideally, layers should have the same resolution and extent
+ Resampling is required if not
+ Output will be restricted to "smallest" extent

Key Advantages
--------------



The raster data model is well suited for continuous phenomena:


* Continuous in **space**
+ Complete coverage within the domain (extent), everywhere has a value

* Continuous in space and **time**
+ Bands can be used to represent time steps
+ Common tool approach for climate data
- i.e., bands 1, 2, 3 ... could represent mean Jan, Feb, Mar temperatures

* Simple data structure makes raster overlay easy and efficient
+ Multiple raster layers can be combined and evaluated using expressions
+ Easy to "show" others what has been done






GeoTIFF
-------



One of the most common/functional raster formats, based of the Tag Image File Format (TIFF). A TIFF file stores metadata (data about the data) as tags. A GeoTIFF is a standard .tif image format plus additional tags spatial tags denoting spatial information including: 


* Extent (minimum x,y and maximum x,y)
* Resolution (cell size)
* Projection, Coordinate system, and datum




Other file types
----------------



Raster data can come in many different formats. You will likely encounter when working with raster data include:


* IMG - A proprietary image format commonly used by ESRI products
* JPEG2000 - A geospatial version of the common .jpg image type
* ASCII - An older human readable format (simple text file) with slower performance than the types listed above





TopHat Question 4
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


The Raster Calculator tool lets you:


* Evaluate algebraic expressions using raster layers as inputs
* Create raster layers
* Calculate the area of raster layers
* Overlay raster and vector layers

Monitoring Vegetation with Satellites
----------------




We're going to work with [LANDSAT8](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/landsat-8) data in this lab.  LANDSAT8 is one of a large number of satellites that orbit the earth continuously collecting multi-spectral (visible light & other wavelengths) imagery.  We can use multi-spectral imagery for a number of different applications like estimating vegetation health.

The lines on the chart below are referred to as a spectral reflectance curves. They show reflectance (amount of light) on the y-axis, defined as the percent of radiation reflected by different earth features, and wavelength on the x-axis. As you can see, the spectral reflectance curves for different features look very different. Specifically, you can see that healthy green vegetation has very high reflectance in the near-infrared wavelengths (0.7-1.4 µm) and lower reflectance in the visible part of the spectrum (0-0.7 µm), while water absorbs almost all incoming infrared radiation and thus has very low infrared reflectance. Soil has relatively higher reflectance in the visible wavelengths, and intermediate reflectance in the near infrared.

TopHat Question 5
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


What does NDVI tell us?

* Vegetation Height
* Vegetation Health/Density
* Vegetation Species
* Number of Plants per Square Meter
* Location and Age of Forests
