Spatial is Special
==================



::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}

Spatial data has special properties that we must take into consideration

First Law of Geography
----------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


"Everything is related to everything else,  
but near things are more related than distant things."   
 -Waldo Tobler

First Law of Geography
----------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


This might seem obvious:


* Students in the same class interact more.
* Orca pods in different areas develop different dialects.
* Hemlocks in BC are more related to each other than to hemlocks in NB.

First Law of Geography
----------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Not a **grantee** of similarity.


* Vancouver's average snowfall is < 30 cm/yr
* Grouse Mountain frequently exceeds 9 m/yr

First Law of Geography
----------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


What do you have in common with your neighbor?


* Are you in the same city?
* Do you have the same major?
* Are you from the same hometown?

TopHat Question 1
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Everything is related to everything else, but ...


* near things are less related than distant things
* near things are more related than distant things
* near things are aren't related than distant things




:::

Spatial Homogeneity
-------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Even distribution of discrete objects trough space, or values (qualitative or quantitative) across a continuous field.



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}

:::
::::




Spatial Heterogeneity
---------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Uneven distribution of discrete objects trough space, or variation of values (qualitative or quantitative) across a continuous field.


* Opposite of **Spatial Homogeneity**

Spatial Heterogeneity
---------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


![](videos/SiteTour.mp4)




:::
::::




Spatial Autocorrelation
-----------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


A measure of similarity Homogeneity/heterogeneity.


* Positive: Clustered/grouped in space
* Negative: Dispersed across space
* Many natural systems exhibit **positive** spatial autocorrelation




:::
::::




Spatial Autocorrelation
-----------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


![](images/03-autocorrelation.png)




:::
::::




TopHat Question 2
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


These phenomena tend to exhibit a high degree of spatial autocorrelation (select all that apply)


* Air Temperature
* Elevation
* Precipitation
* COVID Cases
* Randomly Selected Samples




:::
::::




Revisiting Scale
----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


**Map scale**: ratio of map units to real world units.


* Small Scale: Large area, more generalization, less detail.
* Large Scale: Small area, more detail, less generalization.



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}

:::

Time Scale
----------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

Time is "one dimensional", but many of the same concepts related to scale apply.


* Just as features are exhibit spatial autocorrelation, they typically exhibit temporal autocorrelation



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}


![](images/03-time-scale.png){width="150%"}



:::
::::




Analysis Scale
--------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Different phenomena operate on different temporal and spatial scales.


* No need to model tornadoes in a global climate model.
* Impractical to map turbulence globally.



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}


![](images/03-scales.png)



:::

Analysis Scale
--------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Different phenomena operate on different temporal and spatial scales.


* Identify the scale relevant to your analysis.

TopHat Question 3
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Tobler's First Law of Geography applies to time just as it applies to space.


* True
* False




:::
::::




Bonini's paradox
----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


As a model of a complex system becomes more complete, it becomes less understandable.


* It will eventually be just as difficult to understand as the real-world processes it represents
  + A 1:1 scale map is as big as the feature you're mapping
  + A life size model house ... is the size of a house

* At a certain point, we have to ignore the heterogeneity.

::::




Map the Forest not the Trees
----------------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


We don't need the location of every tree to map a forest.


* Use average presence of trees over a larger area
* Group by dominant species or category

:::

Similarity Across Space
-----------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Often, the system we want to map will exhibit high degrees of both spatial heterogeneity **and** autocorrelation.


* What is *heterogeneous* at one scale may be **homogeneous** at another.



:::
::::




Spatial Data Models
-------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


We can exploit spatial autocorrelation to simplify data representation.

:::
::::




Spatial Resolution
------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Relates to the level of spatial detail in a dataset.


* What is the smallest feature that is included in a dataset?



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}


![](images/03-resolution.gif)




:::
::::




Temporal Resolution
-------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Relates to the level of temporal detail in a dataset.


* Over what time period is the data valid?
* Are there multiple observations?



:::

Resolution vs. Scale
--------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


The scale of our analysis dictates our desired resolution. But data resolution can limit the scale of our analysis.




:::

Scale Dependence
----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}

:::

Scale Dependence
----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="55%"}



Acknowledge heterogeneity where appropriate.


* Large scale maps might need more attention to detail.
* Higher resolution data.



:::
:::{.column width="45%"}


![](images/footprint_class.jpg)




:::
::::




Scale Dependence
----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="55%"}


Count on spatial autocorrelation  
 and call a unit homogeneous where appropriate.


* Smaller scale maps can be more generalized.
* Lower resolution data.



:::
:::{.column width="45%"}


![](images/LCM.png)



:::
::::




Scale Dependence
----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="55%"}


At even smaller scales, more and more generalization is required.


* Some features become indistinguishable
* Even lower resolution data is sufficient

Spatial Data Models
-------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Raster and vector models are distinct approaches for addressing the same task.

TopHat Question 4
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Spatial data models exploit spatial autocorrelation to simplify our representation of spatial features.


* True
* False
