Choosing Data Model
===================



::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


 Which data model is better?
 
:::
::::




TopHat Question 1
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


The spatial data models we use in GIS work by taking advantage of: (select all that apply)


* Tobler's First Law of Geography
* Causality
* Spatial Autocorrelation
* Spatial Heterogeneity
* Cheat Codes




:::
::::




TopHat Question 2
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Bonnini's Paradox states that: As a model becomes more complex model becomes, it becomes:


* More useful
* Less understandable
* Easier to use
* Larger

Comparing Data Models
---------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


### Raster


Usually **continuous fields**


* Full coverage over domain
+ Grid of equally sized cells
+ Data "gaps" must be given a value   
 (i.e., NODATA)

* Separate bands for each attribute
+ Each cell has **one** value per band
+ One raster can have **many** bands



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}


### Vector


Usually **discrete objects**


* Only represents features of interest
+ Points, Lines, and/or Polygons
+ Can overlap, have gaps, or be continuous

* Each object can have **many** attributes
+ Attribute table links spatial and non-spatial data

* Topology rules
+ Connectivity and relationships between features

Advantages
----------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


### Raster


* Good for continuous variables
+ Features that do not have distinct boundaries

* Simple data structure
+ Overlay is easy and efficient



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}


### Vector


* Good for discrete objects
+ Features that are have distinct, fixed in boundaries

* Compact data structure
+ More efficient storage

* Easy to query and select by attributes




:::
::::




Disadvantages
-------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


### Raster


* Mixed pixel problem
* One attribute per cell
* Large data volumes



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}


### Vector


* No variability within polygons
* Complex data structure
* Overlay can be computationally expensive




:::
::::




TopHat Question 3
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Select the best method for representing each phenomena:


* Precipitation observations from weather stations across Canada
* Precipitation forecasts for an atmospheric river
* Census tracts in Metro Vancouver
* Hiking trails in Garibaldi Park

Resolution &. Scale
-------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


These properties can influence our choice of model.


1. How does the scale of our analysis dictate our desired resolution?
2. How can resolution of the data limit the scale of our analysis?

Resolution &. Scale
-------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


We want to work with high resolution data because:   

 **↑ resolution = ↓ generalization = ↓ uncertainty**


* But in reality, this isn't always practical or possible. High resolution data may
+ Be too expensive $$$
+ Take too long to collect or process
+ Infringe on individuals privacy or endanger marginalized people

* We must try to strike a balance
+ Find what suits our needs without hindering adding unnecessary risk, expense, or complexity




:::
::::




Things to consider
------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


What is the "lowest" acceptable resolution?


* Smaller scale analysis won't need the same level of detail.
* Looking at national immigration patterns, maybe you only need provincial level data?




:::
::::




Things to consider
------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Change the scope of our analysis?


* If you need a high resolution analysis, work at a larger scale and focus on a small area.
* If you need to analyze a large area, work at small scales and accept the uncertainty that comes with coarser resolution.




:::
::::




Working Together
----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Frequently we'll end up working with both raster and vector data in the same analysis.


* In Module 1, you worked with:
+ Cholera deaths (points)
- **Vector Data Model**

+ Kernel density (probability of deaths)
- **Raster Data Model**

Working Together
----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


- In the [Module 4 Lab](https://geos270.github.io/Module4/docs/Application.html) you are converting between data types

* NDVI (**Raster Data Model**)
* Census units (**Vector Data Model**)
* Exploring two approaches
+ **Zonal Statistics:**  
 Faster, but in a more limited applicability.
+ **Raster to Polygon Conversion:** Converting between data types requires more, but it is more flexible.

TopHat Question 4
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Which of the following are true (select all that apply):


* Scale is a property of your analysis while resolution is a property of your data.
* Scale is a property of your data while resolution is a property of your analysis.
* Scale and resolution are properties of your analysis.
* We always want to work with the highest resolution data available.
* Both the raster and vector data models are useful ways to represent spatial data.

TopHat Question 5
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


How do you feel about the pace of lecture and the lab workload so far?


* The pace of lecture is too fast and the lab workload is overwhelming.
* The pace of lecture is good and the lab workload is overwhelming.
* The pace of lecture is good and the lab workload is manageable.
* The pace of lecture is too slow and the lab workload is manageable.
* The pace of lecture is too slow and the lab workload is too easy.
