Ethics in GIS
=============



::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


GIS has potential to have drastic impact on peoples lives.



:::
::::




What is Ethics
--------------


A branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of right and wrong. Theory and standards that inform one's moral practice.

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}



* Ethics and legality are not synonymous
  + Laws society has constructed may be informed by ethics

TopHat Question 1
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


This branch of philosophy deals with the nature of right and wrong:


* Logic
* Ethics
* Epistemology
* Metaphysics




:::

Ethics in Science
-----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Research often involves handling the sensitive information:


* Information will be used in a safe and respectful way
* In some fields, ethics boards review research proposals to ensure best practices are used
  + How will the data be used?
  + Who will have access to data/results?
  + What identifying information will be used/released?




:::
::::





Data Privacy and Security
-------------------------

Higher resolution data = more accurate representation of the phenomena. 

* Allows for better decision making but infringes on privacy

* How specific is too specific?
  + Point locations risk exposing personal information



Data Privacy and Security
-------------------------

Organizations have guidelines surrounding exposure of information.

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

* Public health agencies don't release information about individuals
* Stats Canada masks census blocks with low response rates

The Power of a Line
-------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


What side of a border you live up on can have drastic impacts on outcomes. Where you live determines:


* What rights you have
* What schools you attend
* How much your vote matters (if you even get to vote)
* How much you pay in taxes
* What services you have access too
* Where you can travel




:::
::::




The Power of a Line
-------------------

Borders are often **arbitrary** and **modifiable**.


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}




* Think back to the modifiable areal unit problem
  + The decisions of a few can impact many

Redlining
---------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


The systematic denial of services to marginalized groups by governments and banks used it to segregate communities

* Direct impact on transfer of inter-generational wealth

Redlining
---------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


For much of the 20th century, redlining was legal and wide spread across North American cities. 

* More researched in the US
* Important to note it occurred in Canada as well

TopHat Question 2
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


The modifiable areal unit problem is a serious issue. Instead of voters choosing their politicians, it allows politicians to choose their ______.


:::
::::




Data Representation
-------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Every cartographic choice can have ramifications.


* How we display data impacts how it is perceived
  + Maps influence the way people think
  + They can reinforce (or counter) biases

* All maps lie, but some lie more than others.
  + Abstraction is a necessary part of map making
  + But it needs to be done carefully




:::
::::




All Maps Lie
------------

Sometimes the lies are intentional.


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

* Maps can be crafted to sway public opinion and influence political outcomes
+ This is a serious ethical issue

:::
:::{.column width="50%"}

All Maps Lie
------------

Sometimes the lies are careless oversights.


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


* Different projections cause areas to be different sizes
  + May intention of the map maker
  + Nonetheless it will influence the way people think



:::

All Maps Lie
------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="45%"}


Sometimes the lack of context is the issue.


* Map over-represents republican votes
  + It may not be an intentional choice 
  + Nonetheless it influences the way people think

All Maps Lie
------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="45%"}


There are strategies to correct these issues


* Adjust the map area to give more context

##### US House of Representatives 2022 Election with Equally Sized Districts


:::
::::


All Maps Lie
------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}


There are strategies to correct these issues


* Adjust the map area to give more context
* **Cartograms**: Sacrifice spatial accuracy to emphasize other attributes

Who Has Access to GIS?
----------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Many GIS products (e.g. ArcGIS Pro) have expensive licensing fees. 

* Beyond just the cost of the software:
  + Hardware to run GIS is not always accessible
  + Training takes time. 

* Options to make GIS more accessible to the public
  + But they can only go so far




:::
::::




Open Source GIS
---------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Free to access; created and maintain by volunteers. There are open source alternatives for GIS:


* [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) is an application with similar functionality to ArcGIS Pro.
* Python, R, JavaScript etc. are open source programming languages that have many GIS packages
* Sites like [stackexchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/) and docs pages (eg [qgis](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS)) 

  + They require a base level of knowledge first




:::
::::




TopHat Question 3
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Open source software and documentation make GIS more


* Profitable
* Accessible
* Difficult




:::
::::




Public Participation in GIS
---------------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


There are many ways the public can be involved in GIS; the can participate actively or passively.


* Public engagement is crucial way to increase representation of opinions and trust in institutions
* Not all participatory approaches are centered on engagement
+ They can also be passive




:::
::::




Volunteer Geographic Information
--------------------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


The collection, processing, assembly, and dissemination of geographic data provided voluntarily.


* Usually some sort of "wisdom of the crowds" is used to validate data, or else data verification and validation is performed by the organizing group
  + See [Chae et al. (2015)](https://geos270.github.io/Modules/6/readings/Chae_et_al_2015.pdf)
* Equally likely to be used for commercial purposes:
  + E.g. Trip Advisor, Flickr, Twitter, etc.



:::
::::




Citizen Science
---------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Allows interested volunteers and researchers to team up to address some scientific question.


* Volunteers provide the “leg work” of data collection, data cleaning, and initial interpretation of field data; guided by scientific research experts
* Participation levels can range from simple data collection through to contributing to academic journal submission.
  + The [COCORAHS](https://maps.cocorahs.org/) platform is a great example!




:::
::::




Participatory GIS
-----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Prioritizes empowerment and inclusion of marginalized people.


* Members of a community generate their own data
  + People share their data and combine into a community map/database
  + Coded into a GIS to systematize the knowledge and allow for spatial analysis

* Emphasizes engagement throughout the GIS process




:::
::::




Inuit Land Use and Occupancy
----------------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}


Participatory GIS to safeguard Inuit rights to Arctic lands and waters.


* Inuit People became increasingly concerned about resource extraction projects
* Commissioned a study on land use and occupancy that was instrumental in the establishment of Nunavut

Inuit Land Use and Occupancy
----------------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


No references to published work or other secondary sources of information:


* Existing maps and information had significant colonial bias
* 100 % Original Data collection from Inuit Sources


:::
:::{.column width="50%"}


![](images/ILUOP_2.png)


:::
::::


Positionality
-------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Reflect on your relation to your work: a researcher's privileges, biases, and preconceptions can impact the communities they are work with and the results they produce. 


* In the "hard" sciences, there is often a claim of total objectivity, but total objectivity is **impossible**
  + No one can be 100% objective
  + Must be acknowledged regardless of the field




:::
::::




Positionality
-------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Some important questions to ask yourself, and points you may want to disclose depending on the context.


* Who am I and where do I come from?
* What is my relationship to the community/field I am working in?
* What are my motivations for this work?
  + What biases may I have and how may my past experiences influence how I engage with this work?




:::
::::




TopHat Question 4
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


This is the concept of reflecting on your relation to your work, what your motivations are, and what biases you might have.


* Objectivity
* Positionality
* GIS Ethics
* Cartography
