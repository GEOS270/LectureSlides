What is GIScience?
------------------

The science and study of geospatial information: 

* GIScience is a framework we use to understand spatial information.  

  * Rooted in Cartography, but it is inherently multidisciplinary 
  * Draws on Computer Science, Mathematics & Statistics, Remote Sensing, and many other fields.

What is a GISystem?
-------------------

Any system or tool we use to store and analyze geospatial information can broadly be considered a GISystem.  

* Until a the late 20th century, atlases and library map catalogues were our most advanced GIS.  
* Now we have a wide range of computer and web based GISystems.  
  * Ranging from the "desktop" GIS applications like ArcGIS Pro that you will be using to cloud computing systems that can Terabytes of planetary scale data.
