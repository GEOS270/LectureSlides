Modern GIS
==========

GIS has become a powerful, widely used tool for GIS in recent decades.


Proprietary GIS Software 
------------------------

GIS is very much rooted in capitalism and the capitalist enterprise.  Consequently many of the initial developments in GIS were by for profit companies.  

* [ESRI](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home) is a leading producer of GIS software.  They make ArcGIS Pro, the software package we will be working with most in this class.  


Proprietary GIS Software 
------------------------

**Proprietary** software requires a license and restricts access to source code.  Common examples include:

* Operating Systems: Windows OS, Mac OS, IOS
* Programming Languages: MATLAB, VBScript
* Software Packages: Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, Power Point etc.), Adobe Illustrator, IOS, ArcMap

Proprietary software licenses are often expensive.  They pose a barrier to access many users.

ArcGIS Pro
----------

An [ArcGIS Pro](https://www.esri.ca/en-ca/store/overview) license is very expensive!

* As a UBC student, you get discounted access
* ArcGIS Pro is a good place to start for new uses
  * Once you learn the basic, you can move on to cheaper options


Open Source GIS
---------------

**Open Source** software is free to use, published under an open copyright license.  Users have the right to view, edit, and distribute the source code.  Common examples include:

* Operating Systems: Linux OS, Android
* Programming Languages: Python, R, Java, etc.
* Software Packages: Libre Office (Writer, Calc, Impress, etc.), Ink Scape, QGIS

Open source software is more accessible because its free to download and use.

Open Street Maps

Programmatic GIS
----------------

::::{.columns}

Python, JavaScript, R, etc. can be used to for GSI.

* I created this webmap using JavaScript.  
* I'll talk a bit more about these methods later on in the term.

Fremium Services
----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

Companies like [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/) and google provide some geospatial services that are "free" to a point.  

* [Google earth engine](https://code.earthengine.google.com/) provides its cloud based computational capabilities to non-commercial users free of charge.
