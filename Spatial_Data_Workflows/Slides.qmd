GIS Workflows
=============



::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


 The flow of information through a project.

GIS Research Process
--------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


1. Define your research question
	* Identify the problems you will address and determine scale of your analysis
	* Explore the available data
	
		+ Adjust your research question as needed* Outline a plan for your analysis
2. Conduct your analysis
	* Clean, convert, reproject, and reclassify input data
	* Spatial overlays, statistical tests, summary statistics, etc.
	* Refine and incorporate more data as needed
3. Share your results
	* Visualizations, reports, publications, press releases, etc.
	* Identify new questions
	
		+ Good research often generates more questions than it answers

Visualizing a Workflow
----------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


It is a good idea to think through a workflow before conducting it.


* A flowchart is a diagram that outlines the key steps in an analysis
* A flowchart can help you
+ Identify necessary analysis steps
+ Think through the logical progression of analysis steps
+ Catch errors **before** you start working
+ Share your planned analysis with colleagues, funding organizations, etc.

TopHat Question 1
=================


::::{.columns}

A \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is a diagram that outlines the key steps in an analysis.

An Applied Example
------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Port Alberni has needs a new tsunami evacuation shelter and you have been tasked with finding a suitable location. The shelter must:


1. Outside the flood zone:
* > 15 MASL **or** > 1 km from coast.

3. > 1.5 km from existing shelters.
4. < 250 m from an Arterial Roadway.
5. Not on Residential, Commercial, or Industrial parcels.

Visualizing a Workflow
----------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


It is best to create a workflow that is repeatable, modifiable, and sharable.


* "Point and Click" GIS is not repeatable
* This can create issues when you:
+ Need to write up a report
+ Want to share how you completed a task
+ Have to redo or update complex analyses

Model Builder is a good solution for beginners.


* It lets you define you analysis steps using a flowchart
+ Inputs are run trough the geoprocessing steps
+ Models are easy to save and update
+ Can be exported as custom tools

* Helps you visualize your results and share them with others

TopHat Question 2
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


This is useful tool in ArcGIS Pro that lets you define your analysis steps using a flowchart and create repeatable workflows.


* Model Builder
* Geoprocessing
* Raster Calculator
* Google Earth Engine
* Python

If you pursue a GIS career, or any other science, you should consider learning to code.


* Code is replicable, legible, and even more explicit than a model
* Python is a great option for geospatial analysis
* Javascript is great for making web based applications and interactive visualizations
* R is useful for statistical analysis
