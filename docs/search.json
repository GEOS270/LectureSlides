    "text": "Monitoring Vegetation with Satellites\nWe’re going to work with LANDSAT8 data in this lab. LANDSAT8 is one of a large number of satellites that orbit the earth continuously collecting multi-spectral (visible light & other wavelengths) imagery. We can use multi-spectral imagery for a number of different applications like estimating vegetation health.\nThe lines on the chart below are referred to as a spectral reflectance curves. They show reflectance (amount of light) on the y-axis, defined as the percent of radiation reflected by different earth features, and wavelength on the x-axis. As you can see, the spectral reflectance curves for different features look very different. Specifically, you can see that healthy green vegetation has very high reflectance in the near-infrared wavelengths (0.7-1.4 µm) and lower reflectance in the visible part of the spectrum (0-0.7 µm), while water absorbs almost all incoming infrared radiation and thus has very low infrared reflectance. Soil has relatively higher reflectance in the visible wavelengths, and intermediate reflectance in the near infrared."
