Map Projections
===============



::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}

Taking the 3D Earth and displaying it on a 2D surface:   
 Types of projections and what we use them for.
:::
::::




Projected Coordinate Systems
----------------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


A map projection is a transformation applied to a geographic coordinate system (GCS).


* Allows us to "convert" from 3D coordinates (Lat/Lon) to 2D coordinates (meters)
* Why does this work?
+ While the GCS is a 3D coordinate system, it only references locations **on the surface** of the oblate spheroid



:::

Projection Methods
------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


There are three main ways to project the 3D oblate spheroid onto a 2D plane.


* **Planar:** A plane is referenced to "Earth's" surface
* **Conic:** A cone is referenced to "Earth's" surface
+ The cone must be cut to flatten it

* **Cylindrical**: A cylinder is referenced to "Earth's" surface
+ The cylinder must be cut to flatten it



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}

Projection Methods
------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


How/where to reference the surface influences how the map is distorted.


* **Tangent:** when projections touch the "earth's" surface at a one point or line
+ Point for planar projections, line for conic and cylindrical projections

* **Secant:** when projections touch the "earth's" surface along two lines
+ Helps minimize reduce distortion

* These are the only locations on map without distortions



:::

Planar Projections
------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Sometimes also called azimuthal or zenith projections, planar projections are the simplest approach.


* Limited applicability/scope and are typically only used for polar regions.

Conic Projections
-----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Conic projections are a great option for the mid-latitudes. They have one central meridian and one/two standard parallel(s).


* Can only cover one hemisphere at a time

TopHat Question 1
=================

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Some special projections apply more complex transformations.

TopHat Question 2
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Which of the these methods for projecting spatial data are best for global scale maps?


* Cylindrical
* Conic
* Planar
* Azimuthal




:::
::::




Types of Deformations
---------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


All map projections must induce distortions in order to display the 3D earth in 2D, they can cause different distortions in different ways:


* **Tearing**: All projections have tearing (edges)
* **Shearing**: Shapes and angles are contorted
* **Compression**: Changes to area
+ Bit of a misnomer, often results in expansion




:::
::::




Tearing
-------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


All projections require tearing, some projections have more than others.



![](images/Mollewide.png)







:::
::::




Shearing
--------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Shapes and angles are contorted by some, but not all projections.


:::
:::{.column width="50%"}


![](images/Sinusoidal.jpg)



![](images/GallPeters_projection_SW.jpg)








:::
::::




Compression
-----------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Areas can be "inflated" or "deflated" some, but not all projections.


* This can cause **serious** issues when you are trying to calculate statistics dependent upon area!
* Population density is a good example
+ You will get hands on experience with this issue in [Lab](https://geos270.github.io/Module2/)

Types of Projections
--------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


All map projections must induce distortions in order to display the 3D earth in 2D. But there are different types of projections that are designed to preserve some attributes.


* **Conformal**: Shapes and angles are preserved, i.e. they **prevent shearing**
* **Equal-area**: Areas is preserved, i.e. they **prevent compression**
* **Equidistant**: Distance is preserved
+ *Not "globally"*, only in certain regions, ie. the tangent/secant lines

* **True-direction**: Gives shortest route between points (great circle)
+ *Not "globally"*, only certain paths, ie. outward from the center of an azimuthal projection

* **Compromise**: Splits the difference for aesthetics




:::
::::




Conformal Projections
---------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


These projections are designed to maintain the shapes/angles across the map.


* The mercator projection is a good example
+ Because it maintains shape/angles, it can be used to circumnavigate the globe in a sailboat
+ But to maintain shape globally, it must **severely** distort area
+ Scale changes across the map, poor for measuring distances or areas



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}


![](images/conformal.png)




:::
::::




Conformal Projections
---------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


These projections are designed to maintain the shapes/angles across the map.


* The lambert conformal conic projection is also a good example
+ Because it is a conic projection showing a smaller region and it uses secant lines, areal distortions are less obvious/drastic
+ However, the area calculations are not true to reality



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}

Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
-----------------------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Globe is divided into 60 strips 6° wide, spanning 80°N to 80°S.


* Minimal distortion within zones
![](images/utm_1.png)




:::
:::{.column width="50%"}


A special type of conformal projection.


* Only used for "small" areas
![](images/utm_2.png)





:::
::::




UTM Zones
---------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Vancouver is in UTM Zone 10N.


![](images/FinalMap.png)



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}


The Mackenzie Delta, UTM Zone 8N.


![](images/DeltaMap.png)




:::
::::




Equal Area Projections
----------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


These projections are designed to preserves area.


* The gall peters projection is a good example
+ Because it maintains area, it can be used to calculate population density
+ Very useful in GIS where area must be preserved for land analysis
+ Angles/shapes are deformed so it "looks" weird



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}


![](images/equal_area.png)




:::
::::




Equal Area Projections
----------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


These projections are designed to preserves area.


* The albers equal area projection is also a good example
+ Because it is a conic projection showing a smaller region and it uses secant lines, shape/angle distortions are less obvious/drastic
+ You can still see it, especially in the north



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}


![](images/albers.jpg)




:::
::::




Equidistant Projections
-----------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


These projections are designed to preserves distance.


* Distance **cannot** be preserved globally, only specific locations
+ e.g. lines radiating from center of an azimuthal projection
+ e.g. lines of longitude + central meridian of sinusoidal projection



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}




![](images/Equidistant_Azimuthal.png)





![](images/Polar.png)





![](images/Sinusoidal.jpg)





:::
::::




True-direction Projections
--------------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


These projections are designed to preserves direction.


* Direction **cannot** be preserved globally, only specific locations
+ e.g. lines radiating from center of an azimuthal projection
+ Often, equidistant are also true direction but not always
+ Will give us a "great circle" route, the shortest distance between two locations



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}




![](images/Equidistant_Azimuthal.png)





![](images/GreatCircle.jpeg)





:::
::::




Compromise Projections
----------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


These projections are designed for aesthetics.


![](images/Winkel.jpg)



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}


Minimize distortion without preserving any one property.


![](images/Winkel_dist.png)




:::
::::




TopHat Question 3
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


A conformal projection will maintain which properties? (select all that apply)


* Area
* Shape
* Distance
* Angles
* Direction
* All of the above
* None of the above




:::
::::




What projection is right for my map?
------------------------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


There isn't a "correct" answer here, but there are definitely wrong answers.


* You can typically get similar results with a handful of different projections, depending on your application
* Best practice is to **always** use an equal area projection to calculate areas/densities
+ But there are many different equal area projections




:::
::::




Things to Think About
---------------------



Where do the data come from?


* Some organizations use a standard projection
+ Stats Canada: Lambert Conformal Conic
+ British Columbia: BC Environment Albers




What is the map's purpose?


* Conformal/compromise are aesthetically pleasing.
* Navigational maps, use conformal, equidistant, etc.
* Thematic maps (areas/densities) use equal area.



:::
::::




Map Scale
---------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


The relationship between distance on a map to distance in the real world.


* How much smaller is a unit on the map than a unit on the earth?
+ i.e. 1 cm on the map = 1 km on the Earth

* Can be described:
+ Graphically
+ Verbally
+ Representative fraction

Map Scale
---------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


 **Small Scale** 1:10,000,000   
1/10,000,000 = 0.0000001


![](images/small_scale.png)



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}


 **Large Scale** 1:1,000   
1/1,000 = 0.001


![](images/large_scale.png)




:::
::::




Map Scale
---------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


All maps require simplification of real world features. The degree of simplification is a function of the map's scale.


* Smaller scale maps require more generalization.
* Larger scale maps can include more detail.



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}


![](images/scale_general.png)




:::
::::




Map Scale & Projection
----------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Map scale will impact our choice of projection.


* Projections that work at 1:000 aren't necessarily suited for a 1:10,000,000 map
* With conformal projections like the Mercator, scale changes with position on the map
+ Preserves scale "locally"
+ Scale is grossly distorted globally



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}






:::
::::




TopHat Question 4
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


A large scale map shows a \_\_\_\_\_ area of the earth and small scale map shows a \_\_\_\_\_ area of the earth.

TopHat Question 6
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Are there any topics from Module 1 or Module 2 which you would like me to discuss further before moving on to Module 3?
