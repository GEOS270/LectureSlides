Vector Analysis Methods
=======================



::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


 Querying and overlaying vector layers, key operations and techniques.
 
:::

Vector Analysis Methods
-----------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Many operations can be done with vector data.


* Some methods are very similar.
+ Distinctions between methods can be subtle, but important.
+ Can complete the same tasks, but need slight changes to a workflow.

* Typically in GIS there are multiple ways to get the same answers.
+ Some "routes" are just more direct.

Querying Attributes
-------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Finding features of interest based on attributes.


* A good way to reduce data volumes, export queries to new layers
* In ArcGIS Pro you can **Select by Attribute**
+ Uses SQL (Structured Query Language)
+ Check equality, relative magnitude, etc.
+ Combined with operators: **AND** / **OR**

* If we're only interested in historic residential buildings:
+ Where "YEAR BUILT" ≤ 1950 **AND** "TYPE" = "Residential"
+ Save as a new layer, won't have to search through all the objects every time.

Sample SQL queries


* **Where "SPECIES" = "Pine"**
* Where "SPECIES" ≠ "Pine"
* Where "HEIGHT" ≤ 5
* Where "SPECIES" = "Pine" AND "HEIGHT" ≤ 5
* Where "SPECIES" = "Pine" fc0314OR "HEIGHT" ≤ 5

Proximity Analysis
------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Looking at spatial relationships within or between layers.


* A good way to reduce data volumes, export queries to new layers.
* Multiple options, depending on our needs.
* If we're only interested in buildings within 1 km of streams:
+ Identify by proximity
+ Save as a new layer, won't have to search through all the objects every time.



:::
::::




Select by Location
------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

Use [Select by Location](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/map/working-with-layers/using-select-by-location.htm) when you want to check for spatial relationships. There are many relationships we can check for:


* Containment
* Intersection
* Distance

Geometric Manipulations
-----------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


These methods create new layers with altered "geometries". Geometry is a term we use to refer to points, lines, and/or polygons in a vector layer.




:::
::::




Buffering
---------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Use the [Buffer](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/analysis/buffer.htm) tool to create a new Polygon layer based on distance.


* Buffer points, lines, or polygons using a buffer distance or set a field to specify varriable distance.
* Use the [Multiple Ring Buffer](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/analysis/multiple-ring-buffer.htm) tool for multi-criteria buffers.




Example From ESRI Docs

Dissolve
--------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


[Dissolve](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/data-management/dissolve.htm) aggregates features.


* Merges objects completely or by attribute(s).
* Can calculate statistics for aggregated regions.
* Useful if our data is more "complex" than we need it to be.

TopHat Question 3
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


This tool allows us to aggregate vector objects in a layer, either completely or by specific attribute values.


* Buffer
* Dissolve
* Select by Attribute
* Merge




:::

Feature Overlay
---------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


When we have multiple data layers and we want to combine them to form a new output.




:::
::::




Clip
----


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Use the [Clip](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/analysis/clip.htm) tool to cut one layer down to the boundaries of another.


* Works like a cookie cutter
* Useful when we want to focus on a study area
* Does not alter attributes
+ Input layer: our data layer
+ Clip layer: the study area



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}



Example From ESRI Docs

Input


![](images/clip_inpt.png)




Output

Erase
-----


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Use the [erase](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/analysis-toolbox/erase.htm) tool to remove the area of one layer from another.


* Opposite of the clip tool
* Does not alter attributes
* Useful when we want to discard/exclude an area



:::

Intersect
---------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


[Intersect](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/analysis-toolbox/intersect.htm) lets us see **only** where layers overlap and combine overlapping attributes.


* Can handle more than two layers at once
* Splits features by overlaps and merges attribute tables
* Useful when we want to merge and parse data at the same time



:::
:::{.column width="50%"}



Example From ESRI Docs

Union
-----


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Use the [Union](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/analysis-toolbox/union.htm) tool to combine multiple layers, split features where they overlap and combine attributes.


* Similar to intersect, but keeps overlapping areas
* Adds attributes from all overlaps.
* Can handle more than two layers at once.
+ Null values where for new attributes where no overlaps are present.

* Useful when we want to merge layers.

Many More
---------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


There are many more vector overlay tools! I have presented some of the the most frequently used tools, but if you have specific use cases you may need others. I can't cover them all, and I don't want to overwhelm folks.




:::

TopHat Question 4
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Clip and erase remove portions of layer based on location relative to another layer but they do not alter the attribute table.


* True
* False
