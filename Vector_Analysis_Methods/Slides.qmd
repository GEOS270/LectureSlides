Vector Analysis Methods
=======================



::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Querying and overlaying vector layers, key operations and techniques.
 
:::
::::

Vector Analysis Methods
-----------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Many operations can be done with vector data.


* Some methods are very similar.
  + Distinctions between methods can be subtle, but important.
  + Can complete the same tasks, but need slight changes to a workflow.

* Typically in GIS there are multiple ways to get the same answers.
  + Some "routes" are just more direct.

:::
::::

Querying Attributes
-------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Finding features of interest based on attributes.


* A good way to reduce data volumes, export queries to new layers
* In ArcGIS Pro you can **Select by Attribute**
  + Uses SQL (Structured Query Language)
  + Check equality, relative magnitude, etc.
  + Combined with operators: **AND** / **OR**

:::
::::


Querying Attributes
-------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Finding features of interest based on attributes.

* If we're only interested in historic residential buildings:
  + Where "YEAR BUILT" ≤ 1950 **AND** <br>"TYPE" = "Residential"
  + Save as a new layer, won't have to search through all the objects every time.

Select by Attribute
-------------------


::::{.columns}

Sample SQL queries


* **Where "SPECIES" = "Pine"**
* Where "SPECIES" ≠ "Pine"
* Where "HEIGHT" ≤ 5
* Where "SPECIES" = "Pine" AND "HEIGHT" ≤ 5
* Where "SPECIES" = "Pine" fc0314OR "HEIGHT" ≤ 5

Proximity Analysis
------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Looking at spatial relationships within or between layers.


* A good way to reduce data volumes, export queries to new layers.
* Multiple options, depending on our needs.
* If we're only interested in buildings within 1 km of streams:
  + Identify by proximity
  + Save as a new layer, won't have to search through all the objects every time.



:::

[Select by Location](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/map/working-with-layers/using-select-by-location.htm)
------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

Use to check for spatial relationships such as:


* Containment
* Intersection
* Distance

Geometric Manipulations
=======================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


These methods create new layers with altered "geometries". Geometry is a term we use to refer to points, lines, and/or polygons in a vector layer.

:::
::::

[Buffer](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/analysis/buffer.htm) 
---------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


Create a new Polygon layer based on distance.

* Buffer points, lines, or polygons using a buffer distance or set a field to specify varriable distance.
* Use the [Multiple Ring Buffer](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/analysis/multiple-ring-buffer.htm) tool for multi-criteria buffers.

[Union](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/tools/analysis-toolbox/union.htm)
-----

Combine multiple **polygon** layers, split features where they overlap and combine attributes.


* Similar to intersect, but keeps overlapping areas
* Adds attributes from all overlaps.
* Can handle more than two layers at once.
  + Null values where for new attributes where no overlaps are present.

Many More
---------


::::{.columns}

There are many more vector overlay tools! I have presented some of the the most frequently used tools, but if you have specific use cases you may need others. I can't cover them all, and I don't want to overwhelm folks.

TopHat Question 4
=================


::::{.columns}
