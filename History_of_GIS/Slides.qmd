History of GIS
--------------

A holistic understanding of GIScience can help you use GISystems more effectively **and** responsibly.  

* A good way to start off is to look at the history of the discipline


Pre-Historic Maps
-----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="55%"}


Many of the first maps are difficult to recognize as such.


* Rock art, pottery, carving, and etchings
* Movement, gestures, & oral traditions
* Paper and Textile maps appeared later

Backstory: Germ Theory
----------------

Early [germ theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease) developed 2000 years ago.  

* Islamic physicians later formalized the basics. Ibn al-Khatib's writings on the bubonic plague in [1362](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Khatib#On_the_Plague):

  + *"The existence of contagion is established by experience [and] by trustworthy reports on transmission by garments, vessels, ear-rings; by the spread of it by persons from one house, by infection of a healthy sea-port by an arrival from an infected land [and] by the immunity of isolated individuals."*  


Backstory: Miasma Theory
----------------

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

Yet European physicians clung to the [miasma theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miasma_theory) for many centuries.

* Attributed diseases such as cholera to “bad air”

A Case Study: Hand Washing
----------------

The Vienna Maternity Hospital had two clinics with different maternal mortality rates. 

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
 

* First clinic run by physicians and students
  + Started each day with postmortems, then went to the maternity ward
  + **Did not wash hands**

:::
::::


A Case Study: Hand Washing
----------------

Midwives had more sanitary practices and they did not do postmortems.

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
 

* Consequently they had lower mortality rates.
* New chief resident Ignaz Semmelweis suspected contagions from the cadavers were to blame

:::
:::{.column width="50%"}

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Yearly_mortality_rates_1841-1846_two_clinics.png)

:::
::::

A Case Study: Hand Washing
----------------

In 1847, Semmelweis mandated hand washing and sanitizing instruments with a chlorine solution for both clinics.

* By 1848, mortality in both clinics fell to 1.3%.
  + Semmelweis' was replaced in 1849
  + Sanitizing fell out of practice and death rates began to rise again.

A Case Study: Hand Washing
----------------

Despite the overwhelming evidence, the hand washing was rejected by the European medical community because it was in conflict with the Miasma theory.

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
 
* Some were offended by the idea that physicians were vectors for disease transmission

Foundations of Epidemiology
----------------

[Dr. John Snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow#Cholera) was a in London where cholera outbreaks were a frequent due to poor sanitation practices.  

* Dr. Snow was a skeptic of the miasma theory and a proponent of germ theory
* In 1849 he proposed cholera that it was spread by fecal contaminated water
  + Compared cholera rates between London districts supplied by different water companies

Foundations of Epidemiology
----------------

During an 1854 outbreak in SoHo, Dr. Snow identified the point source of the outbreak using a hand-sketched map.  


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="55%"}

* Recorded cases using a dash and pumps with a circle
  + Created what today would be called a **dot map**
  + Traced cases to the Broad st. water pump

:::
:::{.column width="45%"}



![](images/Snow_Map.jpg)


:::
::::

Foundations of Epidemiology
----------------

Dr. Snow convinced the government to remove the pump handle and the outbreak subsided


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="55%"}

* The medical community in London continued to reject germ theory
* Miasma theory wouldn't be dispelled until the invention of the microscope twenty years later

:::
:::{.column width="45%"}

:::

Belief Perseverance
----------------

Rejection of sanitary practices in the European medical community is an example of [belief perseverance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief_perseverance).

* A common issue that has impeded numerous scientific advancements (eg. plate tectonics, climate change, vaccines, etc).
  + Belief perseverance has many causes but it is often exacerbated by misogyny, racism, and ethnocentrism.



Canadian Context
----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="55%"}


Cartography facilitated colonialism and territorial expansion throughout Canadian history.


* The British and Canadian governments conducted surveys to map out resources
* Treated the land as a "blank canvas"
