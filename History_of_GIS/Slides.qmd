History of GIS
==============

From prehistoric maps to modern GIS.

History of GIS
--------------

A holistic understanding of GIScience can help you use GISystems more effectively **and** responsibly.  

* A good way to start off is to look at the history of the discipline


Pre-Historic Maps
-----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="55%"}


Many of the first maps are difficult to recognize as such.


* Rock art, pottery, carving, and etchings
* Movement, gestures, & oral traditions
* Paper and Textile maps appeared later

Advent of Surveying
-------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="70%"}

Revolutionized navigation and cartography.


* Follow constant bearing and reach any location on earth
  + Still used today 
  + Google Maps etc.

The Mercator Projection
-----------------------

* Constant bearing
* Sea bird
* Great circle



Spatial Analysis
----------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}


As our representation of space became more accurate and precise, our ability to make spatial inferences expanded as well.
