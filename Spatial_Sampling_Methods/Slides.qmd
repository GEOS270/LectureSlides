Spatial Sampling
================



::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


 How do we collect geospatial information?
 
:::

TopHat Question 1
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


"Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things." This statement is known as:


* Tobler's First Law of Geography
* Tobler's Last Law of Geography
* Geography's First Principal
* The Only Rule of GIS

The First Law of Geography
--------------------------




Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}

* Object/areas near each other are more likely to be similar
Objects/areas near that are distant from each other are more likely to be different
* **This aspect of nature keeps coming in GIS!**

Sampling
--------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


The process of selecting points from within an area or population, called a **sample frame**.

* We collect information for a subset of objects/locations sample frame
  + But we ignore **most** objects/locations
  + Think back to Bonini's Paradox

:::

Sampling
--------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


The process of selecting points from within an area or population, called a **sample frame**.

* How we define the sample frame and choose samples can determine the quality of our data
  + We want to maximize representativeness of the sample
  + But also minimize effort and expense associated with sampling

:::
::::



Scientific Sampling
-------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Requires each element in the sample frame have a known and pre-specified chance of selection.


* **Biased Sampling**: some elements have a greater or lower chance of being selected
* **Unbiased**: every element has an equal chance of being selected 




:::
::::




Random Sampling
---------------



In theory, a random sample is best. Its the "gold standard".

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="55%"}


* **Unbiased**: each location has equal chance of selection
  + Easy to do, randomly select ùë•,ùë¶ coordinates
* A key assumption of many statistical tests



:::

Random Sampling
---------------

Can be difficult to implement in practice.


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="55%"}



* Chance that all samples miss important features
* May be barriers to access
  + Remote or rugged terrain
  + Private property
  + Systematic under-responses



:::
:::{.column width="45%"}


![](images/Random1.png)




:::
::::




Random Sampling
---------------

We have some options to account for the drawbacks


* **"Law of large numbers"**: as we collect more information, our sample will become increasingly representative of actual population values
  + Larger sample sizes or "Bootstrapping"

* Not always practical
  + Requires more time and resources



TopHat Question 2
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


To collect a random sample, every object or location must:


* Have an equal chance of selection
* Be approximately the same size
* Not be close to other samples (i.e., equally dispersed)
* Not have a predefined chance of selection




:::
::::




Alternate Approaches to Sampling
--------------------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


**Biased sampling**


* Create a sample design that trades a sampling scheme for randomness
* Induce bias to the sample to:
  + Save time or resources
  + Account for relevant information about the sample frame




:::

Systematic Sampling
-------------------

A random starting point is chosen and a fixed sampling interval is used.

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

* Randomly select first of 3 students
  + Select every 3rd after

Systematic Sampling
-------------------

A random starting point is chosen and a fixed sampling interval is used.


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}

* Not ideal for discrete objects that exhibit periodicity
  + City blocks, Roads, etc.

:::
:::{.column width="40%"}


![](images/systematic3.png)


:::
::::


Stratified Sampling
-------------------

Address the issues with systematic sampling by sampling at random locations, while applying a "systematic bias"

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}

* Create a systematic sampling grid, then take random samples within cells

* Can avoid over/under sampling regularly repeating features

:::
:::{.column width="40%"}


![](images/stratified1.png)


:::
::::


Stratified Sampling
-------------------

Divide a population by certain attributes, then take random samples from sub-populations

* Account for important factors
  + Gender, race, age, political party, etc.


![](images/stratified3.png)



Cluster Sampling
----------------

Intense sampling of features in clusters around a number of selected locations

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}

* Locations can be selected for specific features, e.g.,:
  + Shopping centers
  + Known history of invasive species

* Or, locations can be selected at random across the grid

:::

Cluster Sampling
----------------

Intense sampling of features in clusters around a number of selected locations

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}

* More efficient use of time and resources
  + May not be representative

:::
:::{.column width="40%"}


![](images/cluster1.png)

:::
::::


Transect Sampling
-----------------

Commonly used along line features like roads & rivers.

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="70%"}

* Focused effort on features of interest
* Requires understanding of spatial structure for maximum effectiveness

TopHat Question 3
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Which of these sampling methods are unbiased?


* Cluster
* Stratified
* Transect
* Random




:::
::::




How Many Samples?
-----------------

The number of samples required is a function of how similar units of that population are.

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}




* Spatial structure can vary wildly across a landscape
  + Knowledge of your study area will help to establish how to best sample 

* Maximize returns minimize effort

Spatial Autocorrelation
-----------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


When the values of objects are related to the values of nearby objects.


* If you know the value of one object, you can make a reasonable guess at the value of nearby objects

Spatial Autocorrelation
-----------------------


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


**Correlation does not imply causation!**


* There could be relationship between features
  + Or a relationship to a third object that determines the values of both
  + Or a completely random coincidence

:::
::::


Statistical Assumptions
-----------------------

Spatial autocorrelation is a problem when it comes to spatial statistics. 

* Most tests assume that there is no relationship between objects by default!
  + By violating this assumption, we ‚Äúbreak‚Äù many common statistics!
  + Spatial statistics explores ways of analyzing statistical relationships across space

TopHat Question 4
=================


::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="100%"}


Which number completes the sequence: 2, 4, 6, \_\_, 10?


* 3
* 8
* 11
* 100




:::
::::




Statistical Interpolation
-------------------------



The process of ‚Äúfilling in the blanks‚Äù that you just performed is called interpolation


* If you know the value of one object, you can make a reasonable guess at the value of nearby objects
+ Over a 2D or 3D surface we call this spatial interpolation

* Intelligent guesswork in which we attempt to make reasonable estimates of the values of a continuous field at places where we do not have measurements







Spatial Interpolation
---------------------

Spatial interpolation only makes sense for a continuous field with numeric values.

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}



* Rainfall, temperature, pressure, elevation
  + Estimate between measured locations

* Can be problematic with qualitative data



:::

Spatial Interpolation
---------------------

Continuous fields tend to exhibit strong positive spatial autocorrelation

* Reasonable to assume missing values are similar to those around them
  + Methods incorporate distance to known samples.

+ Sound familiar? This is Tobler‚Äôs First Law!
  + Closer samples given more weight than distant ones
  + A threshold is usually set, to determine the maximum distance to take samples from


Inverse Distance Weighting
--------------------------



Calculates cell values based on nearby observations.


* Weight cells by distance from observation points
* Mathematical expression of Tobler's Law

Inverse Distance Weighting
--------------------------

Best applied to discrete samples of continuous quantitative variables.


::::{.columns}

* Elevation
* Temperature
* Precipitation

Kernel Density
--------------

Calculates the "density" of discrete objects and converts to a raster surface

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}




* Probability of occurrence across space
  + Weight by "value" of points

* Often applied to counts of qualitative data
  + Disease outbreaks & crime data
